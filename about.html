            <p class="text-lg text-gray-300">My entry into the world of cybersecurity did not begin the conventional way, with ethical hacking or firewalls, but with a much simpler curiosity. As a young teenager, I stumbled upon Discord bots, and I was immediately fascinated that a simple script could respond to messages, moderate chats, and even play music. What started as a hobby soon became an obsession; I wanted to understand not just how to use these bots, but how they worked at their core.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-300">Building Discord bots introduced me to programming logic, APIs, and basic security practices. Along the way, I found myself not just solving my own coding issues, but constantly wondering how these automations could be broken, exploited, and what measures prevented that. My focus shifted from just building the “cool” bots to securing them. This eventually led to my passion for cybersecurity.</p>
